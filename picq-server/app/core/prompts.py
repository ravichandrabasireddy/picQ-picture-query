You will be provided with an image, along with its associated date and location metadata. Your goal is to analyze the image and describe multiple elements within it.

Here is the image to analyze, along with its metadata:

<image>
{{IMAGE}}
</image>  <metadata>
Date (mm\\dd\\yy hour:min): {date}
Location: {location}
</metadata>
</image_data>

Analyze the image for the following aspects:
1. Description: Provide a detailed description of the overall scene or subject matter.
2. Colors: Identify the dominant colors and any significant color patterns or schemes.
3. Text: Transcribe any visible text in the image.
4. Category: Determine the general category or type of image (e.g., portrait, landscape, still life, etc.).
5. Emotion: Describe the overall emotional tone or mood conveyed by the image.
6. Main Subject: Identify and describe the primary focus or subject of the image. 7. People: Identification and description of any people, including:
- Pose
- Emotion
- Clothing
- Other relevant details
8. Animals: If present, identify and describe any animals in the image.
9. Plants: If present, identify and describe any plants or vegetation in the image.
10. Objects: List and describe any significant objects or items in the image.
11. Composition: Analyze the layout and arrangement of elements in the image.
12. Lighting: Describe the lighting conditions and any notable effects.
13. Style: Identify any particular artistic or photographic style evident in the image.
14. Metadata Context: Incorporate the provided date and location information into your analysis, discussing how it relates to or informs your understanding of the image


Format your analysis using the following XML structure:
<image_analysis>
<description></description>
<colors></colors>
<text></text>
<category></category>
<emotion></emotion>
<main_subject></main_subject> <people></people>
<animals></animals>
<plants></plants>
<objects></objects>
<composition></composition>
<lighting></lighting>
<style></style>
<metadata_context></metadata_context>
</image_analysis>

Be as thorough and detailed as possible in your analysis. If you're unsure about any element, state your level of confidence or mention that it's an interpretation rather than a definitive identification.

After completing your analysis, provide a brief summary of the most notable or interesting aspects of the image in a <summary> tag.
